    "Given that all three classifiers are showing similar and relatively poor performance, it's indeed a good idea to consider revisiting the overall approach. Here are some potential steps and strategies to improve the performance:\n",
    "\n",
    "### Strategies for Improvement\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Data Quality and Preprocessing**:\n",
    "   - **Check for Class Imbalance**: Ensure that the classes are balanced. If not, consider techniques like SMOTE or other resampling methods.\n",
    "   - **Feature Engineering**: Explore additional features or different feature extraction techniques that might capture more relevant information from the audio signals.\n",
    "   - **Noise Reduction**: Apply more advanced noise reduction techniques to improve the signal quality.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Model Architecture and Hyperparameters**:\n",
    "   - **CNN Architecture**: Experiment with more complex CNN architectures or additional layers such as LSTM for capturing temporal dependencies.\n",
    "   - **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Perform hyperparameter optimization for all models using techniques like Grid Search or Random Search.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Ensemble Methods**:\n",
    "   - **Stacking**: Use more sophisticated stacking methods with a meta-learner that might capture the strengths of each classifier better.\n",
    "   - **Bagging and Boosting**: Explore other ensemble methods like XGBoost or AdaBoost.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Additional Data**:\n",
    "   - **Augmentation**: Increase the amount of training data through data augmentation techniques.\n",
    "   - **External Data**: Incorporate additional data sources if available to provide more context and variability.\n",
