\section{Critical Reflection}
\subsection{Real-World Deployment}
Our final system demonstrates promising performance in controlled environments. However, deploying it in real-world scenarios would require addressing several challenges, including handling diverse accents, background noise, and ensuring real-time processing capabilities.

\subsection{Adaptations for Real-World Use}
To fulfill real-world requirements, our system could be enhanced by integrating more advanced noise filtering techniques, providing user customization options, and implementing continuous learning mechanisms to adapt to users' speech patterns over time. Additionally, edge computing strategies could be employed to handle real-time processing needs.

\subsection{Conclusion}
The project successfully developed a speech command detection system that performs well in noisy environments. Future work will focus on refining the system for real-world deployment, ensuring robustness, and enhancing user experience.
