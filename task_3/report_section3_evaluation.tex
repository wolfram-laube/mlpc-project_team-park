\section{Evaluation}

\subsection{Chosen Evaluation Criteria}
For the random forest classifier, we primarily used a classification report, as this provided all the key performance metrics for the task, such as precision, recall, F1-score, and accuracy for each class. Based on the report, we were able to fine-tune the hyperparameters to achieve the best possible performance, while also significantly reducing the computing time.

\subsection{Baseline and Best Possible Performance}
Discuss the baseline performance (e.g., simple model or random guess). Estimate the best possible performance and provide reasoning.
